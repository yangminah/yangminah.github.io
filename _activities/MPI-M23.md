The last leg of the trip was at the Max-Planck Institute of Meterology at Hamburg. 
I presented my work on the Ides of March, and had the chance to meet face-to-face with our collaborators, Claudia Stephan and [Laura KÃ¶hler](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/institute/staff/portfolio?tx_mitarbeiterverwaltung_mitarbeiterliste%5Baction%5D=show&tx_mitarbeiterverwaltung_mitarbeiterliste%5Bcontroller%5D=Mitarbeiter&tx_mitarbeiterverwaltung_mitarbeiterliste%5Bmitarbeiter%5D=675&cHash=9ac9ea18f25d8cbbdd56aff3b71dde9d). We learned about the NextGems simulation being done at the institute, which led to my current project. 


The institute had a beautiful interior as well as a strong flora.
