This is Minah Yang's website.

Hello! 
======
I am a postdoc working with [Ed Gerber](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/) at the Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science, a part of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU. 
My research combines scientific computing, numerical analysis, and machine learning (ML) under the theme of extending data science techniques to scientific applications with a special focus on geophysical fluid dynamics and climate science. 


Here's a map of all the places I've lived in!
