I participated in the 2022 Rising Stars in Computational and Data Sciences workshop. It was a great chance to meet other early career women in computational science, present my work, and discuss openly about academic and research careers with prominent women scientists. I highly recommend postdocs and PhD students graduating soon to apply to participate!
