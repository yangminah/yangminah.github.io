title: "Machine learning techniques to construct patched analog ensembles for data assimilation."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022JCP
excerpt: 'Highlights\\
- Domains need to be partitioned when constructing analogs for geophysical models.
- Patches make the training of machine learning models more robust.
- The use of patches makes in data assimilation can be implemented in parallel.
- General autoencoders with an affine transformation in the latent space can be used.
- Patched constructed analogs can approximate ensemble members within DA methods.'
