It was so nice to attend SIAM CSE again! I presented at [MS46
Goal-Oriented and Context-Aware Scientific Machine Learning](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=75416) organized by [Steffen Werner](https://ninsteve.github.io/) and [Thomas O'Leary-Roseberry](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tEvw5mgAAAAJ&hl=en). 
This was the beginning of my 3-week travel, where I attended this conference and visited collaborators. 

Here are some pics from the week in Amsterdam.
