collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021JCP
excerpt: 'Highlights\\
-Integrating Factor methods are the better exponential integrator for wave turbulence.
- A discrete-asymptotic analysis relates difference equations to asymptotic behavior.
- A new near-minimax rational approximation for the matrix exponential is proposed for use in IF methods.
-Implicit-Explicit integrators fundamentally treat wave resonances incorrectly.'
