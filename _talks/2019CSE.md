[This presentation](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=65938) discussed round off error analysis of linear algebra subroutines used for the Householder QR decomposition, as well as its implementation for use in graph analysis task.  Further work on this topic resulted in this [paper](/publication/2021SISC).
