After SIAM CSE, I headed over to near Munich to visit [Veronika Eyring](http://www.pa.op.dlr.de/~/VeronikaEyring/)'s group at the German Aerospace Center ([Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt](https://www.dlr.de/en)).

I presented my work on learning from long-tail distributions. It was a great opportunity to learn about research adjacent to mine-- there are so many atmosphere processes being studied with data-driven approaches in this group! 

Afterwards, I took the train to visit Ed in Berlin, where he was enjoying his sabbatical.

Here are some pics from the week in Oberpfaffenhofen.
View from lodging: can you see the alps?
