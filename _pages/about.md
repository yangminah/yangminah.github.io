This is Minah Yang's website.

Hello! 
======
I am a postdoc working with [Ed Gerber](https://edwinpgerber.github.io/) at the Center for Atmosphere Ocean Science, a part of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU. 
My research combines scientific computing, numerical analysis, and machine learning (ML) under the theme of extending data science techniques to scientific applications with a special focus on geophysical fluid dynamics and climate science. 

#### Latest update:
Here is a fun gif of the dataset I've been wrangling with for the past year. We extracted gravity wave momentum fluxes from a [5km resolution global model](https://easy.gems.dkrz.de/DYAMOND/NextGEMS/index.html#cycle-3) with spectral filtering on the Healpix grid. 
I will be presenting this at AGU23 next week: [Check out this post!](/_activities/AGU23.md)

Here's a map of all the places I've lived in!
