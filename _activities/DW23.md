The DataWave group had a short 2-day meeting hosted by North West Research Associates. We shared our progress and brainstormed ideas of how to move forward.
Important Topics:

- High resolution models inter-comparison - Icon vs loon vs era5
- High resolution data processing
- Post-processing/data storage
- Training noisy data and its difficulties
- Lateral propagation - what are we doing about it?
- Best practices for sharing and writing codes

It felt like the first days winter on these last October days.
