I met SIAM leaders and other CSP fellows. We listened to representatives from NSF-DMS, DOE-ASCR, NASA, White House OSTP about their priorities and afterwards the committee discussed how those priorities align with SIAM's needs and goals. We also visited congressional offices to advocate for funding for mathematics research! [Rising Stars](https://www.sandia.gov/risingstars/)
