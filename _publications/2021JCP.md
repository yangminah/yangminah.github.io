excerpt: 'Highlights: 
Integrating Factor methods are the better exponential integrator for wave turbulence.
A discrete-asymptotic analysis relates difference equations to asymptotic behavior.
A new near-minimax rational approximation for the matrix exponential is proposed for use in IF methods.
Implicit-Explicit integrators fundamentally treat wave resonances incorrectly.
