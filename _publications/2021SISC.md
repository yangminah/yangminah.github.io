This paper is about mixed precision block Householder QR algorithms and their rounding error analyses.  I presented the first half of this work at a [SIAM CSE minisymposium](/talks/2019CSE).  The latter half of this paper devises block Householder QR algorithms designed to accomodate mixed precision arithmetic.
